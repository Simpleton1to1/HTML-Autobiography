  </p1> Gucci Mane, born Radric Delantic Davis on February 12, 1980, in Bessemer, Alabama, is an influential American rapper, entrepreneur, and record executive. He is often credited as one of the pioneers of trap music, a subgenre of hip-hop that originated in the southern United States.

  Gucci Mane moved to Atlanta with his mother when he was nine years old. He began rapping at a young age and released his debut album, "Trap House," in 2005. This album featured the hit single "Icy" with rapper Young Jeezy, which catapulted him to mainstream success.
  
  Over the years, Gucci Mane has released numerous albums and mixtapes, including "Hard to Kill" (2006), "The State vs. Radric Davis" (2009), "Everybody Looking" (2016), and "Mr. Davis" (2017). His prolific output has made him a prominent figure in the rap industry.Gucci Mane's career, however, has not been without controversy. He has faced multiple legal issues, including arrests for drug and weapons charges, as well as an incarceration in 2014 for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. He served two years in prison and was released in 2016.

  During his time in prison, Gucci Mane worked on his physical and mental health, emerging with a renewed focus on his music and personal life. He has since released several successful albums, established his own record label, 1017 Records, and married his longtime girlfriend, Keyshia Ka'oir, in 2017.
  
  Gucci Mane's influence on the trap music scene and his resilience in the face of adversity have solidified his status as a significant figure in the hip-hop community.</p1>
